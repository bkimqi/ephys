%   Takes USV call mean frequencies and times and splits them into low vs.
%   high calls based on the designated threshold.

%   INPUTS:
%   mean_freq, times: output of extract_calls, arrays of times and mean
%   frequency for each call
%
%   threshold (optional): frequency cut-off to separate high from low calls
%
%   OUTPUTS:
%   calls_sep: data structure with calls_sep.low and calls_sep.high. Each
%   of these fields contains the mean_freq and times of each call type.
%
%   high_bool: a boolean matching the size of times with a 1/true value for
%   all high calls and a 0/false value for all low calls
